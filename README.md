Forecasting Bike Share Demand Using Time Series Models in R
Summary of Techniques Used
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Dataset: The analysis utilized the Capital Bikeshare dataset containing daily bike rental transactions along with weather and seasonal information.
Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values and aggregated the daily data into monthly totals for improved analysis.
Data Exploration:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends and seasonal patterns in bike rental counts over time. This included plotting daily rentals and aggregating data monthly for a clearer trend analysis.
Time Series Visualization:

Created interactive and static plots to visualize bike rental demand, which helped identify underlying trends and seasonality.
Smoothing Techniques:

Applied moving averages and exponential smoothing techniques to reduce noise in the data and highlight underlying trends.
Decomposition of Time Series:

Decomposed the time series data to analyze seasonal and trend components separately. This step involved assessing the stationarity of the data using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
ARIMA Modeling:

Fitted an ARIMA model to the time series data to capture the underlying patterns. Used the auto.arima function to automatically select the best ARIMA model parameters based on AIC/BIC criteria.
Conducted residual diagnostics to check for normality and homoscedasticity of residuals.
Forecasting:

Generated forecasts for the next 12 months using the fitted ARIMA model.
Visualized forecast results alongside historical data to assess model performance.
Highlights and Business Impact
Improved Decision Making: By accurately forecasting bike rental demand, the Capital Bikeshare program can better allocate resources, optimize bike distribution, and enhance user satisfaction.

Enhanced Operational Efficiency: Understanding seasonal trends enables the organization to optimize staffing and operational hours, potentially reducing operational costs during off-peak times.

Marketing Strategies: Forecasting helps identify peak rental periods, allowing for targeted marketing campaigns to promote bike rentals during high-demand months.

Data-Driven Insights: The insights derived from the analysis can inform strategic planning and investment in infrastructure, such as additional bike stations or promotional discounts during off-peak periods.

Community Engagement: By analyzing bike share trends and adapting to user needs, the program can foster community engagement and promote sustainable transportation options.
